|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| tortoisebot_base_ros1          | Base image containing with ROS1 noetic + all the required packages for the child image.   |
| tortoisebot-ros1-gazebo        | This Docker image contains everything necessary for starting the Gazebo simulation.       |
| tortoisebot-ros1-slam          | This Docker image contains everything necessary for starting the mapping system.          |
| tortoisebot-ros1-waypoints     | This Docker image contains everything necessary for starting the waypoints action server. |
| tortoisebot-ros1-webapp        | This Docker image contains everything necessary for starting the Tortoisebot webapp.      |

### Usage

You can directly build the image yourself using the following command:  
`./build.sh`

Or you can pull the images from Docker Hub using the following command:  
`docker pull mcognie/maximecognie-cp22:tag`  
where `tag` is one tag of the previous list.  
<br/>  

Then start the containers using docker-compose `docker-compose up`

## Real
---

The docker image tags available for the real robot are the following:

| Tag                            | Description                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| tortoisebot-ros1-real-base     | Base image containing with ROS1 noetic + all the required packages for the child image.                                   |
| tortoisebot-ros1-real          | This Docker image contains everything necessaary for starting all the real robot systems, including the camera and laser. |
| tortoisebot-ros1-slam-real     | This Docker image contains everything necessary for starting the mapping system for the real robot.                       |

### Usage

To build the different images and start the containers you can directly use the following command:  
`docker-compose up --build`  
Or you can pull the images from Docker Hub using the following command:  
`docker pull mcognie/maximecognie-cp22:tag`  where `tag` is one of the tags from the previous list.
